This Project originally started as a way to create custom animations to make unique rpg attack animations. Unfortunately my computer was wiped and I ended up losing a lot of time and work. From there I transitioned to something more simple, a custom screensaver. The program allows the user to add stickers to a page and change their attributes. The stickers can bounce around the screen and the background can also be changed.
